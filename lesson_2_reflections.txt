What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	To add the metadata to git . To let know git that it has to track these files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	Working directory files are not tracked by git. But once files are added to staging area, they are tracked by git. It helps git to find out 
	which files belong to the repository.
